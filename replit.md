# Cortyx - AI-Driven ERP System

## Overview
Cortyx is a metadata-driven Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system with dynamic UI generation. The entire application structure is defined by schemas, allowing the UI to automatically adapt to different data types and business entities without hardcoding specific views.

## Project Architecture

### Metadata-Driven Design
- **Dynamic Navigation**: Sidebar navigation is generated from `/api/modules` endpoint
- **Dynamic Forms**: Forms are automatically generated based on field schemas from `/api/doctypes/:name`
- **Dynamic Tables**: List views are created dynamically based on `in_list_view` field property
- **Link Field Intelligence**: Special modal selector for linking documents across DocTypes

### Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: React, Wouter (routing), TanStack Query, Shadcn UI components, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Express.js with in-memory storage
- **Styling**: Stone color palette with purple accent, Inter font for UI, Space Grotesk for display
