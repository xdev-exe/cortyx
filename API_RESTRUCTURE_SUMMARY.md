# API Restructure Summary

## Problem
The original API had issues with document retrieval when DocType names contained spaces (e.g., "CRM Note"). The error was:
```
GET /api/docs/CRM/CRM%20Note 404 :: {"error":"Document not found"}
```

The URL path `/app/CRM/CRM Note` was being incorrectly parsed by the router, treating "CRM" as the doctype and "CRM Note" as the ID, when actually "CRM Note" is the full doctype name.

## Solution

### 1. Modularized Routes
Split the monolithic `routes.ts` file into separate modules for better organization:

```
server/routes/
├── index.ts       # Main router registration
├── auth.ts        # Authentication endpoints
├── modules.ts     # Module listing
├── doctypes.ts    # DocType schema endpoints
├── docs.ts        # Document CRUD operations
└── README.md      # API documentation
```

### 2. URL Decoding
Added proper `decodeURIComponent()` calls in all route handlers to handle:
- Spaces in doctype names: `CRM%20Note` → `CRM Note`
- Special characters in document IDs
- Any other URL-encoded characters

### 3. Enhanced Logging
Added detailed logging with prefixes for easy debugging:
- `[DocType Schema]` - Schema operations
- `[Docs List]` - Document listing
- `[Doc Detail]` - Single document retrieval
- `[Doc Create]` - Document creation
- `[Doc Update]` - Document updates
- `[Doc Delete]` - Document deletion
- `[Storage]` - Database query operations

### 4. Fixed Storage Layer
Updated `storage.ts` with:
- Proper backtick escaping for Neo4j Cypher queries
- Better error handling and return value checks
- Consistent logging throughout
- Fixed count query to use correct label matching
- Changed `doc.created` to `doc.creation` for consistency

### 5. Query Improvements
- Added `LIMIT 1` to single document queries for performance
- Fixed `ORDER BY` to use `COALESCE(doc.modified, doc.creation, datetime())` for better sorting
- Improved count queries to match actual document labels instead of using Document->DocType relationships

## Changes Made

### New Files Created
1. `server/routes/index.ts` - Main router
2. `server/routes/auth.ts` - Auth routes
3. `server/routes/modules.ts` - Module routes
4. `server/routes/doctypes.ts` - DocType schema routes
5. `server/routes/docs.ts` - Document CRUD routes
6. `server/routes/README.md` - API documentation

### Modified Files
1. `server/index.ts` - Updated import path
2. `server/storage.ts` - Enhanced with logging and fixes
3. `server/routes.ts` - Backed up to `routes.ts.bak`

## API Endpoints

### Authentication
- `POST /api/login` - User login

### Modules
- `GET /api/modules` - List all modules with their doctypes

### DocTypes
- `GET /api/doctypes/:doctype` - Get schema for a doctype

### Documents
- `GET /api/docs/:doctype` - List documents (with pagination)
- `GET /api/docs/:doctype/:id` - Get a specific document
- `POST /api/docs/:doctype` - Create a document
- `PUT /api/docs/:doctype/:id` - Update a document
- `DELETE /api/docs/:doctype/:id` - Delete a document

## Testing

To test the fix:

1. Start the server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. Test the previously failing endpoint:
   ```bash
   curl http://localhost:5000/api/docs/CRM%20Note
   ```

3. Check the logs to see the detailed operation flow

4. Navigate to the frontend:
   ```
   http://localhost:5000/app/CRM%20Note
   ```

## Benefits

1. **Better Organization** - Routes are now logically separated
2. **Easier Maintenance** - Each module is self-contained
3. **Better Debugging** - Comprehensive logging at every step
4. **URL Safety** - Proper handling of special characters
5. **Type Safety** - All routes maintain TypeScript types
6. **Documentation** - Complete API documentation included

## Migration Notes

The old `routes.ts` has been backed up to `routes.ts.bak` and can be removed after testing.

All existing API endpoints remain unchanged - this is purely a refactor with bug fixes. The API contract is maintained.

## Next Steps

1. Test all endpoints with various doctype names (with spaces, special chars)
2. Monitor logs to ensure proper operation
3. Remove `routes.ts.bak` once confident in the new structure
4. Consider adding unit tests for URL encoding/decoding
5. Add more comprehensive error handling as needed
